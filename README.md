# Data Visualizations & Research Portfolio

Welcome to my portfolio of data visualizations, primarily created to accompany my research papers and explore various datasets. This repository serves as a central hub to showcase my ability to translate complex data into insightful and accessible visual narratives.

---

## ðŸŒŸ Overview

This collection features a variety of Jupyter Notebooks (`.ipynb` files), each typically corresponding to a specific research paper or project. The visualizations herein cover diverse topics and utilize various Python libraries to effectively communicate findings and patterns within data.

My aim is to not only present the final visuals but also to provide context regarding the research questions, methodologies, and the stories the data tells.

## ðŸ“‚ How This Repository is Organized

This repository is structured by research project or paper. Each project has its own dedicated folder containing:

* The Jupyter Notebook(s) with the data visualizations and corresponding code.
* A specific `README.md` file within the project folder, providing:
    * A brief overview of the research paper/project.
    * Context for the visualizations.
    * Links to the published paper (if applicable).
    * Details about the dataset used (if shareable or public).
* Potentially, a `data/` subfolder for any small, anonymized, or publicly available datasets used directly by the notebook (if not loaded from an external source).
